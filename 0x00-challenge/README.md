# FizzBuzz Fix

## Description

This Python script, `0-fizzbuzz.py`, addresses the FizzBuzz problem, printing numbers from 1 to a specified limit while following certain rules. 

The FizzBuzz rules are as follows:
- For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
- The script validates and handles a specified number to execute the FizzBuzz sequence.

## Functionality Overview
The script contains a `fizzbuzz` function that takes a positive integer as input and generates the FizzBuzz sequence up to that number.

## Usage
To use this script, follow the instructions below:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script from the command line with the desired number:
   ```
   ./0-fizzbuzz.py <number>
   ```
   Example: `./0-fizzbuzz.py 89`

## File Structure
